# Generous Caius (and Tashpi Ashibael)

OpenMW mod that removes ownership of items, containers, and beds when Caius Cosades or Tashpi Ashibael give them to you.
Compatible with everything since it only uses Lua.
This won't remove ownership if you've already progressed past the checkpoints in the relevant quests.
